# Study Planner

A simple static Study Planner web app to help students organize study sessions, track tasks, and plan daily study goals. This project is implemented as a lightweight single-page site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Add and remove study tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Simple, responsive UI for desktop and mobile
- No backend required — stores data in the browser (if implemented)

## Files

- `index.html` — main page and UI structure
- `styles.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `script.js` — client-side behavior and interactivity

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. To serve locally (recommended for consistent behavior), run a simple static server from the project folder:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Development

- Edit the files in this folder and reload the page to see changes.
- Consider adding localStorage support in `script.js` to persist tasks between sessions.

## Contributing

Fork the repo, make changes, then open a pull request. For small fixes, commit directly to `main` and push.

## License

Add a license file if you plan to publish this project publicly.
